        Music has been part of my life since childhood—rigging rock concerts with my dad at age 6, helping him DJ in my teens, singing in school and queer choirs through my teens and early twenties. The music was always there, humming inside my head.
      </p>

      <p>
        These days I'm exploring music in all sorts of forms: singing shanties at shanty club, generating tracks with <a href="https://suno.com">Suno</a>, solo singing, writing my own lyrics, singing others' lyrics, sometimes playing along on guitar. What I've published so far is performed with Suno, but I intend to record in other forms too.
      </p>

      <p>
        The process is perhaps the most creative and enjoyable part—<a href="/blog">follow my blog</a> to read about it. Each creation has its own journey. I'm an amateur with a lifelong love of creativity and recorded sound, finally getting the music from inside my head to reach my ears—and yours.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please enjoy these for what they are. If you'd like DRM-free files, just reach out—I'm happy to share them somehow.

      <h2>Goodnight Satellites <span class="text-base font-normal text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400">(January 2026)</span></h2>
      <p>
        For the space between awake and asleep. For counting lights in the sky when counting sheep stops working. For pillow forts that became galaxies and oceans made of blankets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drift off. Float away. 🌙✨

        These albums were created using AI music generation tools. The creative process involves experimenting with prompts, styles, and iteration—much like learning any new instrument or creative tool.
