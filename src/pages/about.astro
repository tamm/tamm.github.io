          I'm <strong>Tamm Sjödin</strong> (they/them) — Web Sorceress, Engineering Leader, and professional office dog patter.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently <strong>Head of Technology at <a href="https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/">Australian Geographic</a></strong>, where I'm positioning their digital platforms for the next decade. I lead a distributed engineering team, own the technical vision across editorial and ecommerce platforms, and drive thoughtful AI adoption that enhances storytelling and development efficiency.
        </p>

        <p>
          Previously, I was a <strong>Team Engineering Lead at <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a></strong>, where I coached the Offline team through a period of transformation. We launched <a href="https://www.canva.com/newsroom/news/whats-new-february/">Offline Presenting</a> in November 2024, enabling users to present confidently without an internet connection. I'm proud of helping the team move from chaos to confidence—delivering meaningful impact and showing what's possible when we dream big and support each other.

      <h2>Diversity & Inclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Two decades in tech. Swede in Sydney. Transgender. I bring a unique perspective to diversity initiatives through both professional expertise and lived experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I serve on the <a href="https://www.professionalsaustralia.org.au/Web/Our_Union/Our_Leadership/DEI_Committee/Web/Our_Union/Our_Leadership/DEI-committee-members.aspx">DEI Committee at Professionals Australia</a>, and throughout my career I've championed inclusive workplace practices, supported neurodiversity and remote-first practices, and created equitable hiring processes. Representation matters and inclusive workplaces don't build themselves.
      </p>

      <h2>Queer Run Club</h2>
      <p>
        Outside work, I founded <a href="https://queerrunclub.au">Queer Run Club</a> (QRC) — a community running group creating safe spaces for LGBTQIA+ folks and allies to run, walk, and connect. What started as a way to combine my love of running with community building has grown into something really special. We meet regularly, welcome all paces and abilities, and prove that running can be joyful and inclusive. All paces welcome. Joy mandatory.
