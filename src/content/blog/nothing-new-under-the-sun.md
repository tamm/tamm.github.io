"Alright uh this uh this is an oldie, ah, well... it's an oldie where I come from."

I've been experimenting a lot with making music using [Suno](https://suno.com). And what's really stood out to me is that there's definitely a creative process around learning to use a new tool. It's like when you've only ever played nylon guitar and suddenly you have an electric guitar with a million different filters and effects pedals. It's incredibly fun to experiment with, but it can be really difficult to suddenly make something that sounds like rock music. Even if someone brilliantly demonstrates it—even if you watch the video—it's still really hard to play an instrument you've never played before.

The same way, it's difficult to make something you could call music using a platform that generates it. It's difficult to make visuals using something like [Gemini image generation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/imagen) look truly like your intention. And it's difficult to get [Kokoro TTS](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) to accurately pronounce all the words in a sentence containing multiple languages—like Irish and Swedish place names while speaking English.

I've been wondering a lot lately: "What is art?"

I don't actually have an answer. The question is the interesting part. But what feels truly creative about playing around with Suno is that I feel like I'm being creative when I'm experimenting with this technology, exploring what I can and cannot do. Learning the instrument, so to speak.

And here's the thing: every generation has its cassandras, convinced that modern music is unoriginal trash that will destroy something fundamental about human culture. They're always wrong, but they never stop complaining.

## The March King's Prophecy

In 1906, John Philip Sousa—yes, the guy who wrote all those marching band tunes—[warned the US Congress](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/john-philip-sousa-feared-menace-mechanical-music-180967063/) that recorded music was going to ruin us. Not just culturally, but *biologically*. He predicted that humans would lose their vocal cords through evolution, the same way we lost our tails.

His fear? That the phonograph would eliminate the need for people to make their own music. That we'd become passive consumers instead of active participants. That the "menace of mechanical music" would destroy artistic development.

Spoiler alert: We still have vocal cords. And arguably, recorded music democratized access to music in ways Sousa couldn't imagine. Instead of only hearing professional military bands, people could now experience music from around the world.

Then Spotify took that democratization to its logical extreme: nearly all of history's music, instantly accessible, funded by ads or a subscription fee. The same access people once got through Napster and LimeWire, now legal and convenient. Except Spotify was called piracy when it launched, and given what artists actually get paid per stream, you could argue it still is—just with better PR and a terms of service agreement.

## The Pastiche Police

And he wasn't alone. Sousa was in great company.

Igor Stravinsky—whose *The Rite of Spring* literally caused a riot in 1913 for being too avant-garde—later got accused of being too traditional, too referential. His response:

> "I was attacked for being a pasticheur, chided for composing 'simple' music, blamed for deserting 'modernism,' accused of renouncing my 'true Russian heritage.' People who had never heard of, or cared about, the originals cried 'sacrilege': 'The classics are ours. Leave the classics alone.' To them all my answer was and is the same: You 'respect,' but I love."

In the early nineties, Mark E Smith dismissed Pavement as unoriginal: "It's just The Fall in 1985, isn't it? They haven't got an original idea in their heads." The Fall, of course, were themselves built from American garage rock and krautrock. And Pavement? They went on to influence an entire generation of indie rock.

Just as [video killed the radio star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8r-tXRLazs), and [internet killed the video star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRqlEidPM3M), in 2024...

I love this song. I don't disagree with its concerns about AI and digital artists. But it's also a perfect example of the cycle: a new technology emerges, we declare it's destroying art, and then... we make art commenting on it. The song is a parody—a transformative creative act that's been around forever, now turned toward our newest anxiety. We keep finding ways to create, even when we're convinced creation is dying.

AI killed the digital artist. Right? Right.

## The Pattern

The pattern is always the same:
1. New technology or approach emerges
2. Old guard declares it will destroy music/art/culture
3. Young artists use it to make something interesting
4. Some of it is trash, some of it is transcendent
5. Twenty years pass
6. The young artists are now the old guard
7. Repeat

Music isn't dying. It's never been dying. It's just changing, the way it always has, the way it always will. The only thing that stays the same is people complaining about it.

Maybe the real question isn't whether music is original enough, but whether we're listening with enough love instead of just respect.

Speaking of which, these days my CV isn't just on LinkedIn—it's also on Spotify. I'll be the first to admit it might not be art, but I hope it makes you laugh.
