**Tamm Sjödin** is a queer, nonbinary writer based in Sydney, Australia.

When not writing contemporary romance novels based on their chaotic dating history, they can be found running through Centennial Park, making playlists for people they probably shouldn't be making playlists for, and advocating for LGBTQIA+ inclusion in the workplace.

*The Playlist We Couldn't Keep* is their debut novel.

This book was written with the assistance of Claude, an AI by Anthropic. Tamm provided the real experiences, emotional chaos, and strong opinions about playlists. Claude helped turn it all into sentences, kept track of the timeline, and only occasionally suggested cutting the parts where Tamm got too self-indulgent.

Any remaining melodrama is entirely Tamm's fault.
